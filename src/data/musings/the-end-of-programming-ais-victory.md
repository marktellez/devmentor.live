---

I've been writing code since 1997. I've weathered the dot-com crash, rode the mobile app wave, and adapted through countless framework cycles. But nothing in my 27-year career has shaken me like the current AI revolution. We're not just facing another technological shift – we're witnessing the end of programming as a viable career path for most developers.

## The Great Displacement Has Already Begun

The signs are everywhere, but most developers are in denial. Let me paint you a picture from my recent experiences:

- Junior developer positions have practically vanished
- Mid-level programming tasks are being handled by AI
- Freelance rates have plummeted as clients use AI tools
- Traditional web development jobs are disappearing monthly

The harsh reality? Unless you're working in machine learning or systems programming (C++/Rust/C), your role will likely be obsolete within 5 years. This isn't fear-mongering – it's a wake-up call based on what I'm seeing in the trenches.

## The College Degree Trap

I feel a deep sadness for current computer science students. They're accumulating debt for a degree that's rapidly becoming obsolete. The traditional programming skills they're learning are precisely what AI does best:

- CRUD applications
- API development
- Frontend frameworks
- Basic algorithms and data structures

Universities are still teaching these skills while the industry is being transformed beneath their feet. It's like training telegraph operators in the age of smartphones.

## Economic Reality Check

My personal experience is a canary in the coal mine. As someone who's been consulting and freelancing since the late 90s:

- Project inquiries have dropped 70% since advanced AI coding tools emerged
- Clients are using AI to handle tasks they used to hire developers for
- The remaining projects offer 40-50% lower rates than two years ago
- Many of my developer friends are quietly taking non-programming roles

When I can barely feed my family and farm animals after decades of experience, what hope is there for newcomers?

## The Only Survivors: ML and Systems Programmers

Why are machine learning and systems programming the exception? Simple:

### Machine Learning Engineers
- Work on the very technology replacing other programmers
- Require deep mathematical and theoretical knowledge
- Deal with problems AI currently struggles to solve

### Systems Programmers
- Work on performance-critical code
- Handle complex memory management
- Build the foundations AI runs on
- Require deep understanding of computer architecture

These roles represent maybe 5% of current programming jobs. The other 95%? They're living on borrowed time.

## The Hidden Crisis in Tech Companies

Major tech companies know this shift is coming. Look at the signs:

- Massive layoffs despite record profits
- Increased investment in AI tools
- Quiet freezes on entry-level hiring
- Shift toward ML-focused roles

They're preparing for a future where they need far fewer traditional programmers. The writing isn't just on the wall – it's in their SEC filings and strategic plans.

## Survival Strategies

If you're already in the industry or committed to entering it, here are your options:

1. **Pivot to ML/AI Development**
   - Learn the mathematics behind machine learning
   - Focus on training and fine-tuning models
   - Understand neural network architectures

2. **Move to Systems Programming**
   - Master C++ or Rust
   - Study computer architecture
   - Focus on performance optimization
   - Learn about embedded systems

3. **Become an AI-Human Bridge**
   - Specialize in prompt engineering
   - Learn to optimize AI tool chains
   - Focus on AI integration and deployment

## The Harsh Truth About Timing

The timeline for this transformation is shorter than most realize:

- 2024-2025: Junior roles largely automated
- 2025-2026: Mid-level positions severely impacted
- 2026-2027: Senior roles transformed into AI oversight positions
- 2028+: Traditional programming becomes a niche skill

## Preparing for the Post-Programming Era

The advice I never thought I'd give: don't bet your future solely on programming skills. Instead:

1. **Diversify Your Income**
   - Learn to farm or garden
   - Develop non-tech skills
   - Build multiple income streams
   - Invest in physical assets

2. **Reduce Dependencies**
   - Lower your cost of living
   - Build self-sufficiency skills
   - Create community connections
   - Maintain emergency reserves

3. **Stay Adaptable**
   - Keep learning new technologies
   - Build cross-disciplinary skills
   - Maintain physical and mental health
   - Foster human connections


## Looking Ahead

The next decade will transform not just programming but most knowledge work. We're entering an era where human programming may become as niche as hand-weaving or artisanal blacksmithing – still existing, but no longer a mainstream career path.

For those of us who love coding, this is a bitter pill to swallow. But adaptation is the core skill of any technologist. The question isn't whether to adapt, but how quickly we can pivot to whatever comes next.

Remember: the goal isn't to compete with AI, but to find the niches where human insight remains irreplaceable. They exist – they're just not where most of us are currently looking.
